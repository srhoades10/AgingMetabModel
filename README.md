# Aging and diet mimetic discovery through metabolic modeling

Metabolic activity modeling at genome scale to inform modulators of lifespan and healthspan. Main findings [here](https://github.com/srhoades10/AgingMetabModel/blob/main/MetabModel_AgingFasting_Manuscript.pdf).

## Non-technical Abstract

“Health” is a nebulous term used liberally in both scientific and laymens audiences. Across both arenas, there is consensus that there can be relatively “good” and “poor” health, and there is tremendous focus on deriving singular drugs, optimal diets, or performant workouts which improve health or extend lifespan. The expectation that one drug can dramatically alter physiology permeates scientific research, but optimal diets and lifestyle are more likely to improve health. This goal may first require a commensurately complex analysis of physiology before understanding how to change it. The objective here is to computationally model the entirety of an organism’s physiology and predict interventions to invoke a “healthier” state.
